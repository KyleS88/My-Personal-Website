    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Kyle Shi, and I'm excited to welcome you to my website. </p>
    <p>Here, you'll get to know me a little better and explore some of my interests. </p>
    <p>I was raised in New York City's Lower East Side neighborhood, and I'm an Asian </p>
    <p>American with roots in both China and Taiwan. I'm currently a senior at High </p>
    <p>School for Dual Language and Asian Studies, and I'm passionate about exploring </p>
    <p>new ideas and concepts. I am participating in 2023 All Star Code Summer Intensive </p>
    <p>a program to help teach coding languages like HTML, Javascript, and CSS and </p>
    <p>internship skills to young men of color. Thanks for stopping by, and I look </p>
    <p>forward to connecting with you further!</p>

<div class="my-passion">
<h2>My&nbsp;passion</h2>
<p>My passions range from the athletic field to the digital world of technology. </p>
   <p>Playing American football has been a joy of mine since childhood. </p> 
   <p>The teamwork, strategic thinking, and discipline required to bring fulfillment </p>
   <p>that extends beyond the game. As a fan of the New York Giants, I appreciate and </p>
   <p>idolize how Saquon Barkley exemplifies hard work, grit, and perseverance on and </p>
   <p>off the field. In my free time, I also enjoy video gaming and computer programming. </p>
   <p>First-person shooter games test my video game skills while coding challenges my </p>
   <p>problem-solving abilities through constantly learning new languages and concepts. </p>
   <p>The intellectual stimulation and accomplishment of overcoming complex challenges </p>
   <p>feed my curiosity and drive me forward. Overall, my interests stem from a desire</p>
   <p>for both physical and mental stimulation. Whether on the field, in front of a </p>
   <p>screen, or with lines of code, I find purpose in activities that push me to grow, </p>
   <p>learn and work through obstacles with resilience and good spirit.</p>

<div class="my-goal">
    <h2>My goals</h2>
    <p>I am a very ambitious person who loves to see the </p>
    <p>world change for the better. My primary focus in </p>
    <p>society is to aid in eradicating world hunger. I </p>
    <p>demonstrate this dedication by volunteering at </p>
    <p>food pantries, ensuring that people within the NYC </p>
    <p>communities get the necessities needed to live day </p>
    <p>by day. My ultimate goal is to utilize my software </p>
    <p>development skills to find a way to contribute to </p>
    <p>the issue of world hunger, whether it be in a small </p>
    <p>or significant way.</p>
